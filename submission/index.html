            <p>Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is growing rapidly in a wide range of consumer communications and networks with their autonomy, flexibility, and a broad range of application domains. UAV applications offer possible civil and public domain applications in which single or multiple UAVs may be used. At the same time, we also need to be aware of the potential threat to our lives caused by UAV intrusion. Earlier this year, multiple instances of drone sightings halted air traffic at airports, leading to significant economic losses for airlines.</p>
            <p>This workshop focuses on state-of-the-art anti-UAV systems in a bid to safeguard flights. Historically, radar is certainly a very mature technology for detecting traditional incoming airborne threats. However, today, these small drones are challenging for radar to accurately and reliably detect. It is due to the combination of a very small radar cross section and the erratic flight paths of these UAV drones that make trustworthy detection almost impossible. Indeed, how to use computer vision algorithms to perceive UAVs is a crucial part of the whole defense system.</p>
            <p>The current computer vision research for UAV lacks a high-quality benchmark in dynamic environments. To mitigate this gap, this workshop presents a benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for the area of detecting and tracking UAVs. The dataset consists of sixty high quality, Full HD video sequences (both RGB and Thermal Infrared), spanning multiple occurrences of multi-scale UAVs. This workshop also encourages participants to establish approaches to fully automatic detection and tracking of UAVs in videos. Although solutions can be derived from the off-the-shelf detection and tracking algorithms, the training and customizations of them for UAVs pose unique challenges. Specifically, how to detect and track fast-moving drones in noisy (e.g., occlusion by cloud and buildings, and fake targets like kites, balloons, birds, etc.) environments and how to use infrared images to locate UAVs in total darkness are not explored enough.</p>
            <p>This workshop will bring together academic and industrial experts in the field of UAVs to discuss the techniques and applications of tracking UAVs. Participants are invited to submit their original contributions, surveys, and case studies that address the works of UAVâ€™s detection and tracking issues.</p>
